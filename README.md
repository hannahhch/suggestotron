# Intro To Rails
## Suggestotron Application

### Goal

To teach you Ruby on Rails we are going to use a "Real World" example. You've decided to create a voting system for you and your friends to play with. You've decided at a minimum, you'd like to allow users to:

<li>view the topics sorted by number of votes</li>
<li>vote on topics</li>
<li>create, edit, and destroy topics</li>
